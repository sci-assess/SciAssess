LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing.

Clinical manifestations include progressive cognitive decline, motor impairment, ataxia, visual loss, seizures and early death. To date more than 440 NCL-causing mutations in 13 genes are known.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report clinical and genetic characteristics of a 5-year-old girl affected by ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (NCL7). She had progressive motor and mental deterioration since the age of 2,5\u00a0years. Later she developed progressive vision loss, stereotypies, action myoclonus and epilepsy. By the age of 5\u00a0years she stopped walking. Based on symptoms, diagnosis of Rett syndrome was suggested, but no abnormalities were detected in MeCP2. We identified a novel homozygous mutation in MFSD8 gene (c.525\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009A, p.Cys175Ter). To our knowledge, this is the first report of MFSD8 gene mutation in a Russian patient with variant late-infantile NCL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results enlarge mutational spectrum of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 and demonstrate tremendous diagnosis value of exome sequencing for pediatric NCLs. Also we confirmed that NCL should be suspected in patients with Rett-like phenotype at onset and negative MECP2 mutation.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(mutation, causeof, with), (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, themeof, with)"}

Mutations in the coding gene, POMT1, have been described to be related to a series of autosomal recessive disorders associated with defective alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation, later termed muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies (MDDGs). MDDGs are characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum of congenital muscular dystrophy or later-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, accompanied by variable degrees of intellectual disability, brain defects, and ocular abnormalities. To date, at least 76 disease-associated mutations in the POMT1 gene, including missense, nonsense, splicing, deletion, insertion/duplication, and insertion-deletion mutations, have been reported in the literature. In this review, we highlight the present knowledge of the identified disease-associated POMT1 gene mutations and genetic animal models related to the POMT1 gene. This review may help further normative classification of phenotypes, assist in definite clinical and genetic diagnoses, and genetic counseling, and may comprehensively improve our understanding of the basis of complex phenotypes and possible pathogenic mechanisms involved.\nANSWER: "}], "ideal": "(mutations, causeof, defective), (muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies, themeof, defective), (alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation, themeof, defective)"}

Here, we present an unusual case of UPD in congenital severe factor (F) XIII deficiency. A 6-year-old girl experienced cephalhematoma and umbilical bleeding after birth and easy bruising, and postextraction bleeding since early infancy. FXIII activity was 0% [mother 53.7% and father 132.5% (normal 70-140%)] and the FXIII antigen level was 2.5% [mother 38.9% and father 151% (normal 75-155%)]. The washed platelet FXIII activity was 0.1% in the patient (normal 64-144%), suggesting a deficiency of FXIII-A subunit. The FXIII-A subunit genetic analysis detected a homozygous p.Arg382Ser mutation. A similar heterozygous mutation was detected in the mother but surprisingly, not in the father. Kinship was confirmed by a paternity test. To confirm the possibility of UPD, a test using four markers in the vicinity of the F13A1 gene revealed that she inherited duplicate mutations from a heterozygous mutation in her mother, presenting a unique case of unusual maternal segmental UPD in otherwise unexplained congenital (homozygous) severe FXIII deficiency.
